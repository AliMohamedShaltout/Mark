Each member in the component will have to make issues for the other members of the same component, the issue should include a user story he/she has to do and a deadline not exceeding a few days and before the submition deadline and assign it to a member of the component.
Then when one of you is working on a new issue you have to create a new branch with a name related to your issue, finish your bit then add and commit we push on your branch *git push --set-upstream origin branchname*
Then go on the github page of our repo and create a new pull request and assign a reviewer and an assignee (Preferably Youssef Shoeb as our SCRUM master) then submit the pull request.
Now the reviewer would review your code and confirm its free of errors and merge it to the master branch.
Before you begin working you always need to checkout to master, pull the code then make a new branch for the issue that you are about to start.
